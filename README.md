# Implementing Python List Methods üìù

![1*mqwg-HnWZQcHQ3-k1GAi9g](https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof/python-fundamentals-05-2024/assets/68993494/1cd3453c-4fc5-463d-81a0-81e7b8cfbdc5)


Develop a console-based application that allows users to perform various operations on a list. The application will present a menu of options, each corresponding to a different list method. 
Users can choose an option by entering a number, and the application will execute the corresponding list method.


## ‚úÖ Requirements:
1. Initial List Input:

- Prompt the user to input initial values for the list. These values should be comma-separated.

2. Menu Display:

- Display a list of options for the user, each corresponding to a list method.
Allow the user to select an option by entering the associated number.

3. List Methods to Implement:

- append()
- extend()
- insert()
- remove()
- pop()
- clear()
- index()
- count()
- sort()
- reverse()
- copy()

4. User Interaction:

- Prompt the user for necessary inputs based on the selected list method.
- Display the updated list after each operation.
- Include an option to exit the application.

5. Error Handling:

- Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-integer menu choices, out-of-range indices).
- Provide meaningful error messages and prompt the user to try again.

6. Code Structure:

- Use functions to organize the code (e.g., separate functions for displaying the menu, handling each list method, etc.).
- Ensure the code is modular, readable, and well-documented.

## ‚úÖ Additional Information:

- User Guidance: Provide clear instructions to the user on how to interact with the application (e.g., input formats, expected actions).

## Instructions for Students:

- Understand the Task: Read through the task description and requirements carefully.
- Implement the Functions: Write code for each list method as indicated by the TODO comments. Modify the skeleton to include user prompts and handle inputs appropriately.
- Test Your Code: Run the application and test each list method by selecting different options from the menu.
- Error Handling: Ensure your code handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides clear error messages.
- Submit Your Work: Submit your final code along with a brief documentation of how your application works and any challenges you faced.
